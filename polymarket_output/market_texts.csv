Missiles or drones that are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a "Yes" resolution  regardless of whether they land on the listed country's territory or cause damage.  Actions such as artillery fire  small arms fire  ground incursions  naval shelling  or cyberattacks will not qualify.  If the U.S. does not strike another country by December 31  2026  11:59 PM ET  this market will resolve to "None before 2027". If the U.S. strikes a country that is not listed next  this market will resolve to "Other".  This market will remain open until 5:00 PM ET on the day following the initial announcement/reporting in order to account for the possibility of an earlier strike.   In cases where the precise time of a strike is not confirmed by U.S. government sources the following standards will be applied:   If a strike is announced as happening on a specified date without an exact time  the market will resolve based on the time of the strike based on a consensus of credible reporting. If the timing of the strike cannot be determined by a consensus of credible reporting by 5:00 PM ET on the day following the initial announcement/reporting  the strike will be considered to have occurred on the reported date at 12:00 PM in the time zone in which the strike occurred.   In the case of multiple strikes being announced/reported to have occurred on the same date  with a lack of a precise time being reported for one or multiple of the strikes  a consensus of credible reporting establishing which strike occurred first may be used to resolve the market even if the precise times of the strike(s) aren’t known.  If no consensus of the order of the strikes exists  the market will resolve based on assuming a strike time of 12 PM local time (on the listed strike date) for any strike without a published time.   If a tie still persists due to a shared time zone  the market will resolve according to the order they were announced in.  If publication timestamps are identical or cannot be reliably compared  the market will resolve according to the alphabetical order of the struck countries listed names.  The primary resolution source will be official public statements or publications by the U.S. government (including but not limited to AFRICOM  CENTCOM  EUCOM  INDOPACOM  SOCOM  the Department of Defense  the White House  or other U.S. agencies). A consensus of credible reporting may also be used.  RSS and transient postings: RSS entries  cached snippets  archives  or temporary/removed webpages will not alone qualify.

668679,will-the-maduro-regime-survive-a-us-military-engagement,Will Maduro's rule survive a US military engagement?,This market will resolve to "Yes" if both of the following conditions are met. Otherwise  this market will resolve to "No".  1. There is a military engagement between the military forces of the United States of America and Venezuela by December 31  2025  11:59 PM ET.  A "military engagement" is defined as any incident involving the use of force such as missile strikes  artillery fire  exchange of gunfire  or other forms of direct military engagement between US and Venezuelan military forces. Non-violent actions  such as warning shots or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace  will not qualify as a military engagement. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g.  a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count as a military engagement; however  minor damage (scrapes  dents) will not.  Any U.S. military kinetic strike that impacts Venezuelan land territory will qualify as a military engagement.  Missiles or drone strikes which are intercepted will not qualify as a military engagement regardless of whether they land on adversarial territory or cause damage. Similarly  surface-to-air missile strikes impacting adversarial territory will not qualify as a military engagement (although surface to air missiles fired at an adversarial military aircraft would qualify).  Note: the U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces; Venezuela’s Milicia Nacional Bolivariana (militia) is a “special component” of the Venezuelan National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB); and Venezuela’s Coast Guard (Comando de Guardacostas) is a component of the Venezuelan Navy (Armada Bolivariana) and thus part of the FANB.  2. President Nicolás Maduro is NOT removed from power within the first 30 days after such an engagement ends  with no subsequent engagement occurring.  President Nicolás Maduro will be considered to be removed from power if he resigns  is detained  or otherwise loses his position or is prevented from fulfilling his duties as President of Venezuela within this market's timeframe.  A military engagement which occurs will be considered to have ended once no qualifying incidents occur for 24 consecutive hours following the initial engagement. The relevant thirty day period will begin on the calendar day following this 24 hours. If multiple military engagements occur  the 30-day period will be counted from the first day following the ending of the most recent engagement.  If Maduro is removed from power prior to a qualifying military engagement occurring this market will immediately resolve to "No".  Note: If a qualifying military engagement occurs by December 31  2025  11:59 PM ET  this market will remain open until either Maduro is removed from power or a thirty day period has passed with no subsequent military engagements occurring.   The primary source of resolution for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.

In cases where the precise time of a strike is not confirmed by U.S. government sources the following standards will be applied:   If a strike is announced as happening on a specified date without an exact time  the market will resolve based on the time of the strike based on a consensus of credible reporting. If the timing of the strike cannot be determined by a consensus of credible reporting by 5:00 PM ET on the day following the initial announcement/reporting  the strike will be considered to have occurred on the reported date at 12:00 PM in the time zone in which the strike occurred.   In the case of multiple strikes being announced/reported to have occurred on the same date  with a lack of a precise time being reported for one or multiple of the strikes  a consensus of credible reporting establishing which strike occurred first may be used to resolve the market even if the precise times of the strike(s) aren’t known.  If no consensus of the order of the strikes exists  the market will resolve based on assuming a strike time of 12 PM local time (on the listed strike date) for any strike without a published time.   If a tie still persists due to a shared time zone  the market will resolve according to the order they were announced in.  If publication timestamps are identical or cannot be reliably compared  the market will resolve according to the alphabetical order of the struck countries listed names.  The primary resolution source will be official public statements or publications by the U.S. government (including but not limited to AFRICOM  CENTCOM  EUCOM  INDOPACOM  SOCOM  the Department of Defense  the White House  or other U.S. agencies). A consensus of credible reporting may also be used.  RSS and transient postings: RSS entries  cached snippets  archives  or temporary/removed webpages will not alone qualify.

Otherwise  the market will resolve to “No”.  For any change on the ISW map to qualify for this market’s resolution  the relevant shading indicating Russian control must persist through the next full ISW daily update cycle. If ISW skips a day  shading must persist until the next finalized ISW update is published  regardless of the date. Any continuous shading which reflects either "Assessed Russian Infiltration Areas in Ukraine"  “Assessed Russian Control”  “Assessed Russian Advance In Ukraine”  or “Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours” will qualify.   Once a qualifying condition is met  any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.  If Russia comes into control of the specified territory as a result of a negotiated settlement  this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution  regardless of whether it is shaded red in the ISW map. However  an announcement of a negotiated settlement that gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.  The primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable  information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used. If information from both the ISW and DeepStateMap are rendered permanently unavailable  a consensus of credible reporting may be used.  Note: Any temporary glitches or errors in the map will not be considered.

A "military engagement" is defined as any incident involving the use of force such as missile strikes  artillery fire  exchange of gunfire  or other forms of direct military engagement between US and Venezuelan military forces. Non-violent actions  such as warning shots or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace  will not qualify for a "Yes" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g.  a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a "Yes" resolution; however  minor damage (scrapes  dents) will not.   Any U.S. military kinetic strike that impacts Venezuelan land territory will qualify for a “Yes” resolution.  Missiles or drone strikes which are intercepted will not qualify regardless of whether they land on adversarial territory or cause damage. Similarly  surface-to-air missile strikes impacting adversarial territory will not qualify for a "Yes" resolution (although surface to air missiles fired at an adversarial military aircraft would qualify).  Note: the U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces; Venezuela’s Milicia Nacional Bolivariana (militia) is a “special component” of the Venezuelan National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB); and Venezuela’s Coast Guard (Comando de Guardacostas) is a component of the Venezuelan Navy (Armada Bolivariana) and thus part of the FANB.  The resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.

The previous day’s closing price will be subtracted from the current day’s closing price  and then that difference will be divided by the previous day’s closing price. If the daily percentage change is negative  it will be considered a loss of that percentage in absolute terms.  Daily percentage changes will be rounded to two decimal places away from zero (e.g. a daily percentage gain of 1.995% would be considered 2.00%  and a daily percentage gain of 1.993% would be considered 1.99%)  If any relevant trading day is shortened (for example  due to a market-holiday schedule)  the official closing price published for that shortened session will still be used for resolution.

Otherwise  this market will resolve to "No".  For the purposes of this market  a qualifying "strike" is defined as the use of aerial bombs  drones  or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by Israeli military forces that impact Lebanese ground territory.  A strike on any area within the terrestrial territory of Lebanon counts  including buffer zones.  Missiles or drones that are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a "Yes" resolution  regardless of whether they land on Lebanese territory or cause damage.  Actions such as artillery fire  small arms fire  FPV or ATGM strikes  ground incursions  naval shelling  cyberattacks  or other operations conducted by Israeli ground operatives will not qualify.  The primary solution resolution source will be official government/military statements (Israeli or foreign)  multilateral bodies (UN  etc.)  or a consensus of credible reporting from major international media and national broadcasters/newspapers.  If the date/time of a strike cannot be confirmed by a consensus of credible reporting within 48 hours of this market's end date  it will resolve to "No" regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.

This market will resolve based on the settlement price as it appears on the CME settlement page at the time it is first published for that trading day  regardless of any later corrections or updates.  The resolution source for this market is the CME Group website — specifically  the daily "Settlement" price for the Active Month of Copper (HG) futures.

Otherwise  the market will resolve to “No”.  For any change on the ISW map to qualify for this market’s resolution  the relevant shading indicating Russian control must persist through the next full ISW daily update cycle. If ISW skips a day  shading must persist until the next finalized ISW update is published  regardless of the date. Any continuous shading which reflects either "Assessed Russian Infiltration Areas in Ukraine"  “Assessed Russian Control”  “Assessed Russian Advance In Ukraine”  or “Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours” will qualify.   Once a qualifying condition is met  any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.  If Russia comes into control of the specified territory as a result of a negotiated settlement  this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution  regardless of whether it is shaded red in the ISW map. However  an announcement of a negotiated settlement that gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.  The primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable  information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used. If information from both the ISW and DeepStateMap are rendered permanently unavailable  a consensus of credible reporting may be used.  Note: Any temporary glitches or errors in the map will not be considered.

The Street consensus estimate for New York Times Company’s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $0.88 as of market creation. This market will resolve to "Yes" if New York Times Company reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $0.88 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise  it will resolve to "No." The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents.   If New York Times Company releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS  then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced  the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents; or  if not published there  according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha. If no GAAP EPS number is available from either source at that time  the market will resolve to “No.” (For the purposes of this market  GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS  unless it is not published  in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.)  If the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date  this market will resolve to “No.”   Note: Subsequent restatements  corrections  or revisions made to the initially announced non-GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution  except in the case of obvious and immediate mistakes (e.g.  fat finger errors  as with Lyft's (LYFT) earnings release in February 2024). Note: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates  and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for non-GAAP EPS. Note: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding. Note: For the purposes of this market  IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS. Note: If multiple versions of non-GAAP EPS are published  the market will resolve according to the primary headline non-GAAP EPS number  which is typically presented on a diluted basis. If diluted is not published  then basic non-GAAP EPS will qualify. Note: All figures are expressed in USD  unless otherwise indicated. Note: For primarily internationally listed companies  this market refers specifically to the shares traded in the United States on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq.
